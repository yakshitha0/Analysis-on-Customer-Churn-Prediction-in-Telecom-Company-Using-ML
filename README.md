ðŸ“ŠCustomer Churn Prediction â€“ Telecom Industry
This project focuses on predicting customer churn in a telecom company using machine learning models. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to discontinue their service so the company can take proactive measures to retain them.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview:
Domain: Telecom
Problem Statement: Predict whether a customer will churn (leave) or not, using demographic, usage, and service-related features.
Dataset Size: 3,150 rows Ã— 14 features
Target Variable: Churn (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

ðŸ”¬ Technical Approach:
Data Quality Check & Preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Model Implementation â€“ Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, Bagging, Boosting (AdaBoost, Gradient Boost, XGBoost), and ANN
Model Comparison

ðŸ“ˆ Best Accuracy:
âœ¨ Artificial Neural Network (ANN) â€“ 95% (Train-Test Split: 60:40) âœ¨

ðŸ’¡ Key Insights:
Month-to-month customers churn the most.
Billing issues & poor customer service are major churn drivers.
Low switching costs make it easier for customers to leave.
Competitor pricing & offers impact retention.
